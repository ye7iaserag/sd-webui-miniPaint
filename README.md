# sd-webui-miniPaint

An extension that integrates miniPaint into [stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)
This is a feature rich open-cource image editor that has features I didn't see in other eitor extensions.

## Motivation
Motivation was that I live to run everything locally an sometimes offline, while all the image editing extensions I found were communicating with some sort of api...

## miniPaint
I do not claim any ownership over miniPaint, I just integrated it with [stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) in a couple of hours.
Give some love to [miniPaint](https://github.com/viliusle/miniPaint)
